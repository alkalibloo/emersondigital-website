Most task management apps give you lists. Some give you kanban boards. A few offer calendar views. But we asked ourselves: what if tasks lived in a space where position itself carried meaning?

## The Problem with Lists

Lists are linear. They imply order, sequence, priority from top to bottom. But real work isn't linear:

- Some tasks are urgent but not important
- Some are important but not urgent
- Some are both, some are neither
- And all of this changes constantly

Traditional lists force you to choose one dimension of priority and ignore the others.

## Enter the Grid

The Neon Task Grid is a two-dimensional canvas where:

- **Horizontal position** represents urgency (left = now, right = later)
- **Vertical position** represents importance (top = high, bottom = low)

This creates four natural quadrants:

1. **Top-left**: Urgent AND important - do first
2. **Top-right**: Important but not urgent - schedule
3. **Bottom-left**: Urgent but not important - delegate or batch
4. **Bottom-right**: Neither urgent nor important - consider dropping

Sound familiar? It's inspired by the Eisenhower Matrix, but made dynamic and visual.

## Spatial Memory

Humans are remarkably good at spatial memory. We remember where things are, not just what they are. By giving your tasks a physical location on screen:

- You build muscle memory for where your priorities live
- You can take in your entire workload at a glance
- Moving tasks becomes an intentional, visible act

## The Neon Aesthetic

Why "Neon"? Because productivity tools don't have to be boring.

We've embraced a vibrant, synthwave-inspired visual design that makes managing tasks feel less like a chore and more like interacting with something beautiful. Colors indicate categories, glow effects show urgency, and completing tasks triggers satisfying visual feedback.

## Coming Soon

Neon Task Grid is currently in development. We're building for iOS, Android, and web, with seamless sync across all your devices.
